# Gym-Membership-System
This program is a gym membership management system that allows the user to add, remove, search, and edit information from a person into a database. The database reads and loads from a .txt file and is made up of a hash map, that takes in a string (ID) as the key, and a struct of a persons information, like their name, age, phone number, etc. The main backend executes OOP to allow clean and organize code management. Also, I wrote a bash shell script that tests the code based on the user input. I wanted to show my bash scripting abilties so I figured this project was the right one considering its a big project and has a lot of edge cases where things can go wrong.
