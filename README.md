# Gym-Membership-System
=======
This program is a gym membership management system that allows the user to add, remove, search, and edit information into a database. The database reads and loads from a .txt file and is made up of a vector 
of pairs. The backend c++ program executes OOP to allow clean and organize code management. Also, I wrote a bash shell script that tests the code based on the user input.
